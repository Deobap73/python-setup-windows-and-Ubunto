## Setting Up the Development Environment  

Before diving into Python programming, it's critical to prepare a proper development environment. A well-configured environment ensures that we can write, test, and run our code smoothly, as well as allow us to install libraries and frameworks without conflicts.
I noticed, as I did, that there are some difficulties for programmers who are starting out in Python, in configuring their environment correctly and smoothly, so I created and organized this setup so that Ubuntu is used most of the time, but migrating to Windows whenever necessary, especially for RPA and enterprise application automation.

For this, we will have two configurations:

1. **Configuration in Ubuntu** â€“ Python installation, package manager (pip), VS Code, Jupyter Notebook, and virtual environments.
2. **Windows Setup** â€“ Python installation, integration with PowerShell, VS Code, Jupyter Notebook, and RPA tools.

From there, each module will indicate which system to use, so that it is possible to learn in the way that is most aligned with professional practice.

## Setting up the Ubuntu Development Environment

Many developers prefer Ubuntu because it offers a more stable and flexible development environment, as well as being widely used on servers and cloud infrastructure. However, even if you already have Python installed on your system, it's important to make sure everything is up to date and configured correctly. 

We will also learn how to use virtual environments, which are essential to keep different projects organized without dependency conflicts.

In addition, we'll set up **VS Code**, one of the most popular code editors for Python, and install useful tools like **pip**, Python's package manager. By the end of the setup, you'll have an environment ready to start programming and developing projects in Python without difficulties.

## Checking if Python is already installed

Ubuntu comes with Python pre-installed. To check the version, open the terminal (`Ctrl + Alt + T`) and run:

```sh
python3 --version
```

If the return is something like `Python 3.x.x`, it means that you already have Python installed.

Otherwise, install it with:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
```

Confirm the installation by rechecking the version.

## Installing pip (Python Package Manager)

`pip` (acronym for "Pip Installs Packages") is the default package manager for Python. It is an essential tool for anyone working with Python, as it makes it easy to install, update, remove, and manage third-party libraries and dependencies. These libraries are packages of code created by the community or organizations to solve specific problems, such as data manipulation, automation, web development, machine learning, among others.

To ensure that it is installed:

```sh
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

Verify the installation with:

```sh
pip3 --version
```

## Installing and Configuring VS Code

**Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** is a source code editor developed by Microsoft, which is widely used by software developers around the world. It is known for its versatility, performance, and extensibility, making it an essential tool for programmers in all fields, including those who work with Python.

To install:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install code
```

After installation, open VS Code and install the **Python extension (Microsoft)** for autocomplete, debugging, and linting support.

## Creating and Using Virtual Environments

Virtual environments in Python are an essential tool for managing dependencies and isolating projects. They allow you to create an isolated space where you can install packages and libraries specific to one project, without interfering with other projects or the overall Python environment. Below are the main functions and benefits of virtual environments:

## 1. Dependency Isolation
Each Python project can have its own dependencies (libraries and packages) and specific versions of those dependencies. A virtual environment creates an isolated space where these dependencies are installed, avoiding conflicts with other projects that might use different versions of the same libraries.

### Practical Example:
- **Project A** needs version `1.0` of the `pandas` library.
- **Project B** needs version `2.0` of the `pandas` library.

With virtual environments, you can install different versions of the same library for each project without conflicts.

## 2. Ease of Package Management
Virtual environments allow you to manage dependencies for each project independently. This makes it easy to install, update, and remove packages without affecting other projects or the overall system.

## 3. Reproducibility
By using virtual environments, you can ensure that a project works correctly on different machines or environments. This is especially important when:
- Sharing projects with others.
- Deploying applications to production.

### Let's create one

```sh
mkdir ~/python-projects
cd ~/python-projects
python3 -m venv myenv
```

### Activating the Virtual Environment

```sh
source myenv/bin/activate
```

The terminal will show `(myenv) user@ubuntu:~$`, indicating that you are inside the virtual environment.

### Deactivating the Virtual Environment

```sh
deactivate
```

## Installing Jupyter Notebook (Optional, for Data Science and Machine Learning)

Jupyter Notebook is an interactive and powerful tool widely used by data scientists, researchers, educators, and developers to create and share documents that combine executable code, visualizations, callouts, and mathematical equations. It is especially popular in the Python ecosystem, but it supports several other programming languages, such as R, Julia, and Scala.

## Key Aspects and Functionalities

### 1. Interactive Interface
Jupyter Notebook is made up of **cells** that can contain:

- **Code**: Code cells allow you to write and execute programming snippets. The result of the run is displayed directly below the cell.
- **Text**: Text cells support formatting in Markdown, allowing you to add explanations, headings, lists, links, and even mathematical equations using LaTeX.
- **Visualizations**: Graphs, tables, and other visualizations can be generated directly in the notebook.

### 2. Multiple Language Support
Although it is most commonly associated with Python, Jupyter Notebook supports more than **40 programming languages** through kernels (language-specific interpreters). This makes it a versatile tool for different areas of knowledge.

### 3. Ideal for Data Analytics and Machine Learning
Jupyter Notebook is widely used in **data science** and **machine learning** because it enables:

- Executing code incrementally (cell by cell).
- Visualizing data in tables, graphs, and other formats.
- Documenting the data analysis process in a clear and reproducible way.


If you want to work with **data analysis** and **AI**, install Jupyter Notebook ***inside the virtual environment***:

### Installing Jupyter Notebook

```sh
pip install jupyter
```


To install it inside a virtual environment:

```sh
pip install jupyter
```

To run Jupyter Notebook:

```sh
jupyter notebook
```

This will open Jupyter in the browser.
